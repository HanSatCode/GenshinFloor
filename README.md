# GenshinFloor
It's an wish simulator made at high school student when I was really playing hard on "Genshin Impact".

It is also a repository created to study and utilize HTML, CSS, and Javascript :)

# Current Database
```
[Promotional 5★ Character]
- "Frostflake Heron" Kamisato Ayaka

[Featured 4★ Characters]
- "Wolf Boy" Razor
- "Thorny Benevolence" Rosaria
- "Mujina Ninja" Sayu
```

# How To Play
> Using a keyboard or mouse

Button|Meaning|Note
:---:|:---:|:---:
한 번 도전|Wish|Execute the wish once.
넘기기|Skip|Skip to the point where the corresponding pickup character or weapon item appears.
초기화|Initialization|Deletes the progressed wish data.

You can try the wish using the mouse, or you can tap the keyboard to try the wish continuously.

And You can also use the '넘기기' button to pass the pickup character or weapon until it comes out, and you can also delete the wish by pressing the '초기화' button or pressing the 'F5' key on the keyboard.

# Development Plan
> Enjoy studying HTML, CSS, and Javascript

The ultimate goal is for me to learn coding skills.
The development will continue until I delete this game. Although there may be some problems in developing HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding skills, I will gradually improve functionally. And I'm going to update it so that I can see the wish history through the database.
